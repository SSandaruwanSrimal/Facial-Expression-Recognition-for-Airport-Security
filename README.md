# Facial Expression Recognition for Airport Security

## Project Overview
This project leverages facial recognition technology to enhance airport security by analyzing passengers' emotional expressions to detect potential threats. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, the system identifies unusual behaviors that may indicate criminal intent. The project includes implementations in Python and Java for both web and mobile applications, with integration capabilities for Google Colab and Android Studio.

## Key Features
- Real-time facial expression analysis
- Detection of unusual behaviors
- Integration with airport security systems
- Mobile app implementation
